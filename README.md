# MGH, Inc - Proprietary Content Managers for Concrete5

This is a small collection of custom plugins developed for use with the Concrete5 website MGHUS.com.  These custom packages allow CMS admins to manage client lists, staff members and corresponding photos, and portfolios of previous work.

You can see all of this in action at https://www.mghus.com . The front-end code for this website is also available in another repository on this GitHub account.
